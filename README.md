# Inefficient Data Frame Population in R

This repository demonstrates a common, yet inefficient, method of populating a data frame in R using a loop and the `rbind` function.  The example showcases the issue and offers a more efficient solution using `rbindlist` from the `data.table` package or pre-allocation.

## Problem

The provided R code attempts to create a data frame and add rows iteratively within a loop.  While this approach is understandable, it's inefficient, especially with larger datasets.  Repeated use of `rbind` leads to significant performance degradation as R needs to constantly resize and copy the data frame in memory.

## Solution

The more efficient solution uses `rbindlist` (from the `data.table` package) or pre-allocation to avoid repeated `rbind` calls.  `rbindlist` is optimized for combining data frames and offers a performance advantage, especially for larger datasets.
